       Expressions:
           Something that turns into a value

           Angula expressions are tied to the scope they are in

           Does not display TypeError and ReferenceError to user

        Interpolation:
            Parsing a String and replacing placeholders with values

            In Angular, these placeholders are usually expressions

            The result is automatically updated when placeholder value changes (Two-Way Data Binding)

        <!--
        Expressions don't necessarily have to go only in the body of tag

        They can also be part of tags themselves

        <!--
        ng-src tag:
             To tell the browser not only to try to fetch this URL but at the same time fetch it only when Angular is ready for interpretation of these placeholders

             If using HTML src tag you'll see that there's an error trying to fetch the non-existent URL (with {{state}} literal)

             You'll see that there's no errors anymore because the image only got fetched once Angular got a hold of this HTML and translated all the expressions into their values
