        The browser processes HTML sequentially, that means that conceptually, the browser will combine all of your JavaScript files into one JavaScript file

        It does not matter in which order you declare modules in your HTML or in your JavaScript file if you think of the whole setup as one gigantic JavaScript file

        Once Angular reads in all the module declarations, it will figure out which module depends on which other module, and will instantiate them in the proper order

        However, what you absolutely CANNOT do is declare an artifact for a module before you create that module
